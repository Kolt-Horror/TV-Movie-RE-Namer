# Introduction
This repo is to create and refine the TV and Movie cleaner script.
This script will allow users to take folders and rename said folder with correct movie or TV show name, with out added garbage.

# Getting Started
To use this script all you need currently is a copy of said script and a folder in your downloads folder called "TVM"
You will also want to change the "$finalPath" location to be a location of your choosing with two folders "Movie" and "Show".
